# Research Computing <br>in the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab at University 
### Ben Donnelly, Research Associate
July 2018

name: vs general computing

# Research computing vs. general productivity
## how it differs: resources must be flexible
- Each researcher comes to a project with their own software workflow
--
- MacOS vs Window vs Linux
- R or Excel
- R or Python Pandas
- MS SQL or Postgres

To be honest, I haven't seen much successful use of Linux on the Desktop for research. For those with UNIX workflows, MacOS tends to be more efficient  
--
## Endless formats for input and output! 

---
# Research computing vs. general productivity
## remote access 
- Windows Remote Desktop, also Linux 
- for long jobs
- often work starts on a researchers laptop, gets ported to computational machines 
- also, while traveling

---
# Research computing vs. general productivity
## Outside collaboration
- Requires creating local account for outsiders 
- We do this for researchers who lack capacity for large/long jobs
- In the cases of some software license terms, to grant access to proprietary software such as ArcGIS

--

## Collaborative documents and messaging 
- Google drive and Dropbox
- Duke provides a Box.com service with very large quotas, but we haven't seen much uptake 
- Skype, but the kids are using Slack

name: novel work
class: center, middle
# Ultimately, research is about doing novel work, and sometime requires novel solutions...

## ...but always ask, **"What is reusable?"**
---
name:

# Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab hardware 
## 18 servers in small dedicated server room, 2 server remote 
- 5 computational
- 3 file storage  2 offsite backup storage
- ~20TB of data 
- 10 web and virtualized servers 

--

## Webservers and applications 
- all virtualized using open source KVM
- code repository 
- MGET tools is a series of Arc/Python software extensions we create and distribute
- database instances 
- applications such as OBIS-Seamap

---
# Computational Servers
- currently all running Windows
- multiple versions of ArcGIS
- Solid State Drives

--

## 3 servers with 128GB of RAM
- 500GB of SSD, RAID 0 for performance
- oceanographic data downloaded locally, case by case with MGET tools 

--

## 1 optimized for interactive GIS 
- Without a dedicated video card, screen rendering can be slow compared to desktops

--

## 1 with more open software install privileges, for testing packages 

---

## We recently reached RAM capacity

name:

# DevOps/Sysadmin principals 
##  What are you trying to accomplish? 
- Don't think in terms of technology. 
- Ask **"What is the final state of the data we want?"**
- Frequently reframe this question as work develops

--

## Someone has already done it
- Novel solution is in synthesis, not new coding (Usually!) 
- There's usually a solution, might take two days (Almost always two days) 
- Too busy to develop stand alone solutions (Counterexample: YUM)  

---
# DevOps/Sysadmin principals 

## Keep systems as simple as possible
- network monitoring: monit and custom scripts over the more complex Nagios 

--

## I discovered there were only a few questions where I wanted regular feedback: 

--

- Who has logged on?
- Are there any disk errors? 
- Have backups run?  
- Are any disks full? (for both storage and operating system performance) 

---

# Try different things
- On computational servers, partition discrete data disks vs. one big disk
- remote disks vs. attached storage 
- various types of RAID for older hard disk arrays
- With ideal configuration VMware's latest virtualization software can get close to bare-metal performance 

--

## Computational nodes have ended up non-virtualized Windows machines with direct attached storage; i.e., a big PC.

# Security 
- tradeoffs with usability and flexibility
- VPN, ssh tunnels 
- RDP 
  - lockout policy: https://security.berkeley.edu/resources/best-practices-how-articles/system-application-security/securing-remote-desktop-rdp-system
  - suspend login for an account after five failed attempts
      
---
name:
      
# Backups
- Keep three official copies in two locations
- Backup for backtracking, backup for disaster

---
# A Backup Problem: Zotero  
- literature review project, many researches developing taxa-based collections that we were aggregating 
- multiple instances of Zotero with remote master (paid Zotero service) 
- Zotero issue major update summer of 2017
- Researcher opened Zotero on home computer for the first time in a month, older version of bibliographic data clobbered everyones data
- Zotero developers: UNIQUE BUG YOU FOUND THERE!
- One person was on vacation, had a recent local master (about three days of work lost) 

--
- ** Many months later, working with Zotero, was able to integrate older recovered work with work going forward**

---
name:

# Code repository  
- For versioning code
- For sharing final data products
  - Poor solution for binary files, there are workarounds 
- Self-hosting vs GitHub
  - Data and sharing concerns
  - ArcGIS and other proprietary software can have complex relationships with open source
  - If your code can boost your public profile: GitHub

name:

# More principles and hints
## Do it once, document it. Do it multiple times, script it.
- Time is a tradeoff with automation
- In research computing you aren't always sure of the longterm solution, so measure time spent in automating until you are sure its permanent service 

---
# More principles and hints
## Proprietary software is easy to learn and hard to maintain 
- Again, what it the final state of the data you want?

## Open Source is hard to learn and easy to maintain 
- AKA, It's only free if you're time is worth nothing. 

---
# More principles and hints
## No solution is as permanent is a short term solution
- 'Cause you'll move on to bigger problems
- Makes the case for doing it right, right now.
- Don't fool yourself about revisiting 
- I have the luxury of having been in the lab for years, so when revisiting my short-term solutions I have background knowledge. Still, important to take notes. 
- Have a consistent location for notes.
